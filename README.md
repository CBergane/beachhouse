[add a pic of colors for the site here]

#### Strategy Table

--- | --- | 
User signups | Make it easy for users to signup to the page. |
An easy way for users to display their houses for new custumers | Offer better tools for property owners to list and showcase their properties, encourage more detailed and attractive listings. |
Enhance guest experience | Streamline the booking and check-in process. |
Have a responsive design | Make the content responsive on smaler divices. |


### Scope

Since this is a mock site, there is no actual booking of real houses, but the goal is that I should be able to use it in real life as close to ready to go.
The purpose of this site is for a community to have a portal for their houses to be rented out for a set price.
Some of the functions:

* Responsive design.
* A easy way to sign up.
* List houses that have been approved by the site admin for display.
* An easy way for the site admin to see what's going on and control it.
* An easy way for the owners of the houses to list their house/houses.
