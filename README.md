# Beach House!

![Beach house mockup image](readme/media/mockup.jpg)

Beach House is a mock site for a community that wishes to rent out its summer houses to guests.
The main focus of the site is an easy way for the guests to get an overview of what kind of properties there is to rent, the guest can filter from a list of options to get a more specific house to rent.

If the user is a house owner who wishes to rent out their house, they can fill out an application for the house to the site owner who will get a preview of the house and can then choose to display it.

Visit the deployed site [here](https://airbnbbeachhouse.herokuapp.com/index).

## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy

#### Project Goals

* The website contains simple colours for a modern design and also not to draw attention from the content.
[add a pic of colours for the site here]

* Responsive design to make the website accessible on different screen sizes.

* Structure is easy to understand and navigates effortlessly.

* Site users can register an account to interact with the content.

* The users can both book and add a house for rent.

* The site admin can sort between the houses and choose which to display.


#### User Goals

* As a Site Admin, I want to manage the site content.

* As a Site User, I want to be able to interact with the content.

* As a Site User, I want the information to be easy to find and read.

* As a Site User, I can do a booking or add a house for rent.

* As a Site User, I want to manage the content I created.


#### Strategy Table

Strategy | Description |
--- | --- | 
User signups | Make it easy for users to signup to the page. |
An easy way for users to display their houses for new customers | Offer better tools for property owners to list and showcase their properties, encourage more detailed and attractive listings. |
Enhance guest experience | Streamline the booking and check-in process. |
Have a responsive design | Make the content responsive on smaller devices. |


### Scope

Since this is a mock site, there is no actual booking of real houses, but the goal is that I should be able to use it in real life as close to ready to go.
The purpose of this site is for a community to have a portal for their houses to be rented out for a set price.
Some of the functions:

* Responsive design.
* A easy way to sign up.
* List houses that the site admin has approved for display.
* An easy way for the site admin to see what's going on and control it.
* An easy way for the owners of the houses to list their house/houses.

The colour #CEE1E8 was chosen for the background to be easy on the eyes and make the text readable.
#0D9FBE is used on the main buttons. #E75A0D is used to highlight the hover effects in the menu. #005794 is used on the navbar and the footer.

#### Typography

The main font being used in the site is Poppins, with sans-serif as a fallback in case Poppins doesn't get imported correctly.

## Deployment

This project was developed using a [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) workspace. The code was committed to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/") using the terminal.

### Deploying on Heroku
To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

1. Create the Heroku App:
    * Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
    * Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Attach the Postgres database:
    * In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.

3. Prepare the environment and settings.py file:
    * In the Settings tab, click on Reveal Config Vars and copy the url next to DATABASE_URL.
    * In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory. 
    * Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
    * Add the SECRET_KEY value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
    * Update the settings.py file to import the env file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
    * Update the Config Vars with the Cloudinary url, adding into the settings.py file also.
    * In settings.py add the following sections:
        * Cloudinary to the INSTALLED_APPS list
        * STATICFILE_STORAGE
        * STATICFILES_DIRS
        * STATIC_ROOT
        * MEDIA_URL
        * DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE
        * TEMPLATES_DIR
        * Update DIRS in TEMPLATES with TEMPLATES_DIR
        * Update ALLOWED_HOSTS with ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

4. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
    * Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage and templates.
    * Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
        * web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
    * Go to the Deploy tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository.
    Click on the Deploy Branch and wait for the build to load. When the build is complete, the app can be opened through Heroku.
